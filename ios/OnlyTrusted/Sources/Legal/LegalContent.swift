    Panic Lockdown is an Elite feature designed for the moment when you are already in trouble — a mugging, a kidnapping attempt, an abusive partner demanding your phone, an unlawful seizure in progress. Where Border Mode is a planned, triple-confirmation preset for a crossing you know is coming, Panic Lockdown is a single-tap red button for the emergency happening right now. One tap locks the app, arms Duress Mode so the next unlock drops into the decoy vault and sends the silent SOS, forces aggressive sensor monitoring, disables the share extension so nothing leaks out of the app, disables biometric unlock (PIN-only), and timestamps the moment in the audit log.

    What it is for

    - A self-defence tool when you cannot safely explain what you are doing on your phone.
    - Buying you a hand-off: the attacker sees the decoy vault; your emergency contact gets a signal.
    - Preserving the Fifth-Amendment advantage in US courts by removing biometric unlock from the picture at the exact moment it matters.

    What it is NOT for

    - Obstructing a lawful search, border inspection, warrant, subpoena, or court order. In many jurisdictions, destroying evidence after service of legal process, lying to officers, or interfering with an investigation is itself a crime. OnlyTrusted does not advise you on when any of those apply to your situation.
    - Hiding activity from a victim, a court-ordered monitor, or anyone with a lawful right to inspect the device.
    - Running on a device you do not own or administer.

    Legal reality

    - US — passcode compulsion case law is mixed and jurisdiction-dependent. Biometric compulsion has generally been treated as a physical act and compelled routinely; passcodes have more often been treated as testimonial and protected. The Fifth Amendment advantage of switching to PIN-only is a defensive posture, not a guarantee.
    - UK — RIPA s.49 and Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act can require you to disclose a passphrase; refusal is itself an offence.
    - EU — member states vary. Some require disclosure, some don't.
    - Many other jurisdictions — unknown or hostile. Research your destination and the authority you may encounter before you rely on this feature.

    Practical reality

    Panic Lockdown raises the per-incident cost of a casual coercive search: biometric compulsion is off the table, the share extension cannot leak data, and the next unlock looks like a plausible-but-empty vault. It will not stop a determined forensic lab from imaging unlocked hardware, and it will not help you if you are legally obligated to disclose a passphrase in your jurisdiction.

    What this app will NOT do

    - We will not help someone evade a lawful warrant, destroy evidence after legal process has been served, or obstruct an investigation.
    - We will not add network callbacks that would phone home when Panic Lockdown is armed. Everything stays on device. The silent SOS runs through the local SMS composer with the owner's chosen recipient; nothing goes to us.
    - We will not change the behaviour of Panic Lockdown in a silent update. If the mechanism changes, the "last updated" date above moves and the full text ships inside the new version of the app.

    static let borderModeAndLaw = """
    Border Mode is an Elite preset designed for high-risk crossings — international borders, airports where you may be pulled aside, protests where a device could be seized, hostile territory. One tap stacks every defensive layer OnlyTrusted ships: Dead-Man Wipe forced to 7 days, Duress Mode active, biometric unlock disabled (PIN-only), screenshot blocking and shield watermark on, auto-lock at 30 seconds, and — if you set one up — a plausible "cover identity" shown on the Dashboard and Vault.

    Why PIN-only matters (US courts)

    In most United States federal and state cases, courts have treated unlocking a device by passcode as "testimonial" — potentially protected by the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination — while unlocking by face, fingerprint or similar biometric has been treated as a physical act and compelled routinely. The case law is not uniform (Minnesota, Vermont, Virginia and the Ninth Circuit have gone different ways over the past decade), and it keeps evolving. Border Mode's PIN-only switch exists so you have the stronger argument available at the moment it matters. It is not legal advice and it does not guarantee any specific outcome.

    What Border Mode is NOT for

    - Evading a lawful search, border inspection, or court order. In many jurisdictions, lying to a border officer, destroying evidence after a subpoena, or obstructing an investigation is itself a crime. OnlyTrusted does not advise you on when any of those apply.
    - Hiding activity from a victim or a court-ordered monitor.
    - Running on a device you don't own, or on behalf of another person.

    Jurisdictional reality

    - US — border officers have broad authority to inspect electronic devices at the border. Refusing to unlock can lead to device seizure for forensic examination. Fifth Amendment protection for passcodes is case-law-dependent and not universal.
    - UK — Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act and RIPA s.49 can require you to disclose a passphrase; refusal is itself an offence.
    - EU — member states vary. Some require disclosure, some don't.
    - Many other jurisdictions — unknown or hostile. Research your destination before you travel.

    Practical reality

    Border Mode will not stop a determined forensic lab from imaging your device if your hardware is unlocked or if the authorities have the time and tools. What it does is raise the per-incident cost for a casual search: biometric compulsion is off the table, screenshots and shoulder-surfing are harder, and if the device sits in evidence lockup for more than a week it wipes itself.

    What this app will NOT do

    - We will not help someone cross a border fraudulently or evade a lawful warrant.
    - We will not add network callbacks that would phone home when Border Mode is armed. Everything stays on device.
    - We will not change the behaviour of Border Mode in a silent update. If the mechanism changes, the "last updated" date above moves and the full text ships inside the new version of the app.

    static let duressAndLaw = """
    Duress Mode is a Pro feature designed for the real-world situation where you cannot refuse to unlock your phone — a mugger, an abusive partner, an unlawful demand at a border. The secondary PIN unlocks a decoy vault that looks like a tidy but boring list of trusted contacts, and sends a pre-written SOS text to one trusted recipient so they know what just happened.

    What it is for

    • Protecting the location of your real family roster from someone who physically has your phone and your attention.
    • Buying you time: the coercer sees a believable, dull vault; your emergency contact gets a signal.
    • Giving you a way out of a situation without having to explain anything on screen.

    What it is NOT for

    • Hiding information from a lawful search where you have a legal obligation to disclose. Depending on your country, lying to law enforcement, obstructing a border inspection, or destroying evidence may be a crime. OnlyTrusted does not advise you on when any of those apply to you.
    • Operating on someone else's phone. The owner must set up Duress Mode themselves.

    Legal reality

    Laws about compelled unlock, decoy data, and whether you must disclose a second PIN differ widely:

    • US — the current body of case law is mixed. Several federal and state courts treat biometric compulsion differently from passcode compulsion. There is no universal answer.
    • UK — RIPA s.49 can require you to disclose a key or passphrase; refusal is itself an offence.
    • EU — member states vary. Border searches and compelled-disclosure powers differ by country.
    • Many other jurisdictions — unknown or evolving.

    Before you enable Duress Mode, check what your local law actually permits. If you are being coerced by an abusive partner or trafficker, your safest step is usually to contact a domestic-violence or anti-trafficking hotline that knows your country's legal landscape, not to rely on any app alone.

    What this app will NOT do

    • We will not help an attacker, a stalker, or a trafficker use Duress Mode to conceal activity from a victim.
    • We will not add network callbacks that would phone home when duress is triggered. Alerting runs through the SMS composer on this device, with the owner's chosen recipient; nothing goes to us.
    • We will not change the behaviour of Duress Mode in a silent update. If the mechanism changes, the "last updated" date above moves and the full text ships inside the new version of the app.

    static let callEncryption = """
    A lot of apps claim to "encrypt your calls." Most of the time that claim is sloppy or misleading. Here is the honest version.

    Cellular voice/video (your carrier)
    When you place a normal call from your phone's dialer, the audio runs through your mobile carrier (GSM / VoLTE / VoNR / 5G). That channel is encrypted by the carrier, between your phone and the cell tower, with keys the carrier owns. No third-party app can add end-to-end encryption to that path. Any app that says it can is lying.

    OnlyTrusted does not touch cellular calls. We screen them via a Call Directory Extension and flag spam, but we do not and cannot encrypt them.

    Voice / video calls over the internet
    For end-to-end encrypted calls use Signal, WhatsApp, FaceTime, or iMessage audio/video. Use those for the call. Use OnlyTrusted on the same phone for everything around the call.

    What OnlyTrusted does protect
    • Your family vault: Keychain + AES-256-GCM via CryptoKit.
    • Your audit log: SHA-256 hash chain.

    A privacy and anti-nuisance tool for iOS. It provides an encrypted family contact vault, a biometric app lock, a Call Directory Extension that blocks numbers you add to your block list, and an SMS filter for unknown senders.

    What this app is not
    • It is not a replacement for the system security features built into iOS.
    • It cannot monitor microphone or camera use by other apps on iOS.

    • It cannot draw an overlay watermark on top of other apps (iOS does not allow this).
    • It cannot make your phone untrackable by your carrier.

    If any marketing you see for this app contradicts these points, the marketing is wrong. These terms govern.

    Our responsibilities
    The app will not transmit your data off the device. We will clearly disclose every data-handling practice in the Privacy Policy inside the app.

    OnlyTrusted targets WCAG 2.1 AA (which is also what US Section 508 adopts). Specifically, this app:

    What we commit to

    • Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text and ≥ 3:1 for large text, icons, and dividers. All in-app text tokens have been measured against both light and dark surfaces and against Increase Contrast mode.
    • Dynamic Type: every text style scales when you change Settings, Display & Brightness, Text Size, up to and including the Accessibility sizes (XXXL and larger). We do not pin text to fixed point sizes.
    • VoiceOver: every button has a human-readable label. Decorative icons are hidden from VoiceOver so it doesn't read "shield shield shield" at you.
    • Hit targets ≥ 44×44 points on every tappable control, per Apple HIG.
    • Honors system settings: Reduce Motion, Bold Text, Increase Contrast, and Dark Mode all work without any in-app override needed.

    What we do not claim

    • Formal Section 508 VPAT certification requires an independent accessibility consultant to audit the shipping build. We have not engaged one. The commitments above are self-measured.
    • Older iOS versions (below our minimum deployment target of iOS 17) are not supported.
    • Third-party extensions (Call Directory, SMS filter) rely on iOS's own system UI for enablement. those pages are Apple's, not ours.

    Report an issue
